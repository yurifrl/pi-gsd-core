<objective>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned plans.

`--context` runs an orthogonal check: the running session's context utilization. The workflow asks for the model's tokensUsed + contextWindow, calls `gsd-tools query validate.context`, and renders one of three states:

| Utilization | State    | Action                                                |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| < 60%       | healthy  | no action — context is comfortable                    |
| 60% – 70%   | warning  | recommend `/gsd-thread` to start fresh                |
| ≥ 70%       | critical | reasoning quality may degrade past the fracture point |

<gsd_runtime_cli>
**GSD CLI:** `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools` is the authoritative GSD CLI in this runtime. The pi-gsd-core extension maintains this launcher and points it at the bundled `@opengsd/gsd-core` engine — invoke engine commands as `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools <family> <subcommand> [args...]`.

**Agents:** GSD's agent checks (init.progress / init.new-project) resolve the agents directory from `GSD_AGENTS_DIR`; the pi-gsd-core extension exports it automatically on load, pointing at this installation's GSD agent set.
