<objective>
Generate a structured milestone summary for team onboarding and project review. Reads completed milestone artifacts (ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, CONTEXT, SUMMARY, VERIFICATION files) and produces a human-friendly overview of what was built, how, and why.

Purpose: Enable new team members to understand a completed project by reading one document and asking follow-up questions.
Output: MILESTONE_SUMMARY written to `.planning/reports/`, presented inline, optional interactive Q&A.
</objective>

<execution_context>

</execution_context>

<gsd_runtime_cli>
**GSD CLI:** `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools` is the authoritative GSD CLI in this runtime. The pi-gsd-core extension maintains this launcher and points it at the bundled `@opengsd/gsd-core` engine — invoke engine commands as `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools <family> <subcommand> [args...]`.

**Agents:** GSD's agent checks (init.progress / init.new-project) resolve the agents directory from `GSD_AGENTS_DIR`; the pi-gsd-core extension exports it automatically on load, pointing at this installation's GSD agent set.
