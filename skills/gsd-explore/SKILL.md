<objective>
Open-ended Socratic ideation session. Guides the developer through exploring an idea via
probing questions, optionally spawns research, then routes outputs to the appropriate GSD
artifacts (notes, todos, seeds, research questions, requirements, or new phases).

Accepts an optional topic argument: `/gsd-explore authentication strategy`

<gsd_runtime_cli>
**GSD CLI:** `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools` is the authoritative GSD CLI in this runtime. The pi-gsd-core extension maintains this launcher and points it at the bundled `@opengsd/gsd-core` engine — invoke engine commands as `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools <family> <subcommand> [args...]`.

**Agents:** GSD's agent checks (init.progress / init.new-project) resolve the agents directory from `GSD_AGENTS_DIR`; the pi-gsd-core extension exports it automatically on load, pointing at this installation's GSD agent set.
