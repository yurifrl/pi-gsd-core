**GSD CLI:** `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools` is the authoritative GSD CLI in this runtime. The pi-gsd-core extension maintains this launcher and points it at the bundled `@opengsd/gsd-core` engine — invoke engine commands as `~/.gsd/bin/gsd-tools <family> <subcommand> [args...]`.

**Agents:** GSD's agent checks (init.progress / init.new-project) resolve the agents directory from `GSD_AGENTS_DIR`; the pi-gsd-core extension exports it automatically on load, pointing at this installation's GSD agent set.
